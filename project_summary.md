# Real-Time Collaborative Learning Platform

## Project Overview

I developed a high-performance real-time collaborative learning platform that enables educators and students to interact through a shared whiteboard and chat interface. The platform allows users to create or join virtual classrooms using unique session IDs, collaborate on a digital whiteboard with multiple drawing tools, and communicate via an integrated chat system.

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Real-time Synchronization

I needed to ensure that all drawing actions appeared instantly for all users with minimal latency.

**Solution:** I implemented a Socket.IO-based architecture that achieved remarkably low latency (137-228ms) even under high load. The system successfully processed over 77,900 drawing elements in a 60-second test period while maintaining performance.

### Challenge 2: Scalability

The platform needed to support multiple concurrent classrooms with many users.

**Solution:** I designed a room-based session management system with UUID-based access control that successfully supported 200+ concurrent users with 100% connection reliability during stress testing.

### Challenge 3: Resource Efficiency

The application needed to perform well on minimal hosting resources.

**Solution:** I optimized the Socket.IO connection handling and data transfer protocols to achieve excellent performance (sub-550ms connection times) on a minimal server configuration (0.15 vCPU, 512MB RAM).

## Performance Metrics

- **200+** concurrent users supported
- **137-228ms** average latency for drawing operations
- **100%** connection success rate
- **426-549ms** average connection time
- **77,939** drawing elements processed in 60 seconds

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React 18, React Router, Socket.IO Client, RoughJS, TailwindCSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Socket.IO
- **Testing:** Custom performance testing suite with visualization tools
- **Deployment:** Render.com

## Key Features

- Real-time collaborative whiteboard with multiple drawing tools
- Room-based session system with unique IDs
- Integrated real-time chat functionality
- Dark/Light mode support
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices

## Outcome

The platform demonstrates exceptional performance even on minimal server resources, making it an ideal solution for educational institutions with limited technical infrastructure. The comprehensive testing suite provides concrete metrics that validate the platform's capabilities for handling real-world educational scenarios.
